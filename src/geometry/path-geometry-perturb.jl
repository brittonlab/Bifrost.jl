path-geometry-perturb.jl

Material-agnostic perturbation mechanism for the geometry layer.

`build(sub; perturb=true)` applies the meta the geometry layer can interpret on
its own — `MCMadd`/`MCMmul` whose symbol names one of a segment's *own* struct
fields (`:length`, `:radius`, …) — via [`_apply_field_mcm`](@ref). Any meta this
layer does not recognize (e.g. a foreign thermal annotation) is carried through
untouched; interpretation of foreign meta is the consuming layer's job.

The companion transform [`_scale_length_fields`](@ref) multiplies a segment's
length-dimensioned fields by a scalar factor. It is the reusable mechanism that a
consuming layer (the fiber assembly) uses to apply isotropic expansion, supplying
both the factor and the replacement meta. Nothing here references temperature or
material properties.

Which fields are length-dimensioned is declared per segment type by
[`_length_fields`](@ref); a new `AbstractPathSegment` that omits it errors loudly
when perturbed, so the extension point is self-documenting.
"""

# Segment types (StraightSegment, …, JumpBy), the meta vocabulary (MCMcombine,

rate is handled separately by [`_scale_length_fields`](@ref) (divided, not
multiplied). Each concrete `AbstractPathSegment` must declare this; the fallback
errors so a newly added segment type cannot be silently mis-scaled.
